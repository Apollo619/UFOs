# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Help a Data Journalist, *Dana*, visualize a JavaScript of **UFO** sightings in McMinnville Oregon to display an interactive dashboard on her webpage for would be UFO enthusiasts. 

### Purpose:
Using VS Code, generate a  **JS** and **HTML** script that will display Dana’s data as well as a related UFO article for people visiting the webpage to interact with (see below image for snippet of JS script).

## Results:
Thanks to a little bit of coding, we have created a webpage that allows UFO enthusiasts to see reported sightings from all over North America. 
-	When a user visits the website they will see the well know phrase ***”The Truth Is Out There”***.
-	Followed by the article Dana has requested be presented. 
-	And lastly, an interactive table of UFO sightings with individual filters by *Date*, *City*, *State*, *Country*, & *Shape* of sightings. This dynamic database is the main feature of the webpages. 
	- When a user inputs ***”tx”*** for example into the state filter parameter, the table will change to display all sightings reported in the state of Texas (see below image)

	- A user can take it one step further and search using multiple filters. For example after inputting ***”tx”***, you can then filter by **”Shape”** (see below image).

	- Finally, if a user wants to clear the filters applied, they can do one of two things
	  - One, they can clear out each search parameter inputted and hit enter or
	  - Two, they can click on the text *”UFO Sightings”* at the top of the webpage that will automatically return the table set to its original display.

## Summary:
One minor drawback to the design of the system is the input criteria used for the webpage. A couple of things can be done to improve the overall user ability of the website. 
1.	Change the search criteria from direct input to a drop-down menu.
a.	This will show the user to know what is available for search parameters of each filter function versus the visitors having to find out what to filter by. (See image below for example)

2.	The *”UFO Sightings”* text at the top of the webpage doubles as a refresh button for the data table.
a.	If we change the formatting of the text to indicate that it is a refresh button or added an additional *“Clear Filters”* button near the other filters, this will provide visitors a clearer flow of the website.  (see below image)
